# Configuration file of the Resources available in DASH-SoC
# Lines that start with "#" are comments

# Add a new resource using the keyword: add_new_resource
# The format: add_new_resource $resource_type (string) $resource_id (int) $num_of_supported_functionality (int)
#             The previous line must be followed by these three functionalities
#             $functionality_name (string) $execution_time (float) $power_consumption (float)
#
# Example: The following lines add a new CPU with ID=0 that can run 3 different tasks
#          add_new_resource CPU 0 3
#          scrambler 12 14
#          reed_solomon_encoder 15 16
#          bpsk_modulation 18 30
