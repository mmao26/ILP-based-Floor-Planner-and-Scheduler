# Configuration file of the Tasks
# Lines that start with "#" are comments

# Start adding task using the keyword: add_new_tasks
# The previous line must be followed by these three attributes
# $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
# The format: add_new_tasks $num_of_tasks (int)
#             $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
# Example: The following lines add a new task with ID=0, and
#          predecessor for this task is task with ID=2
#          (empty list means there is no dependency)
#
#           add_new_tasks 1
#           scrambler 0 2
